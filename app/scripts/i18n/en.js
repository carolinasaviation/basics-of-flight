		title: 'What is drag?',

		historicalDescription: 'The Wright brothers, Orville (August 19, 1871 – January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867 – May 30, 1912), were two American brothers, inventors, and aviation pioneers who were credited with inventing and building the world&rsquo;s first successful airplane and making the first controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air human flight, on December 17, 1903.'

	lift: {

		equation: 'L\' =  \rho v \Gamma\,',
		equationDescription: 'The lift of an object can be calculated using the Kutta–Joukowski theorem.',
		historicalFigure: 'throwaway-kutta.jpg',
		historicalDescription: 'Kutta was born in Pitschen, Upper Silesia (today Byczyna, Poland). In 1901, he co-developed the Runge-Kutta method, used to solve ordinary differential equations numerically. He is also remembered for the Zhukovsky-Kutta aerofoil, the Kutta-Zhukovsky theorem and the Kutta condition in aerodynamics.'

This is a description of the force of weight and its effects on an airplane. This is a description of the force of weight and its effects on an airplane. This is a description of the force of weight and its effects on an airplane.'

	weight: {
		title: 'What is weight?',
		equation: 'W = mg',
		equationDescription: 'The weight of an object is equal to the mass of an object multiplied by the force of gravity.',
		historicalFigure: 'throwaway-newton.jpg',
		historicalDescription: 'Thrust is a reaction force described quantitatively by Newton&rsquo;s second and third laws. When a system expels or accelerates mass in one direction, the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on that system.'

		equation: '',
		equationDescription: 'Flaps are responsible for increasing drag.',
		historicalFigure: 'throwaway-flaps.jpg',
		historicalDescription: 'Flaps are hinged surfaces mounted on the trailing edges of the wings of a fixed-wing aircraft to reduce the speed at which an aircraft can be safely flown and to increase the angle of descent for landing. They shorten takeoff and landing distances. Flaps do this by lowering the stall speed and increasing the drag.'

		title: 'What&rsquo;s an aileron?',
		equation: 'F = m * a',
		equationDescription: 'French for &lsquo;little wing&rsquo;',
		historicalFigure: 'throwaway-aileron.gif',
		historicalDescription: 'An aileron is a hinged flight control surface usually attached to the trailing edge of each wing of a fixed-wing aircraft. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in roll, or movement around the aircraft&rsquo;s longitudinal axis, which normally results in a change in heading due to the tilting of the lift vector. Movement around this axis is called &lsquo;rolling&rsquo; or &lsquo;banking&rsquo;.'

	rudder: {
		title: 'Rudder',
		equation: 'W = mg',
		equationDescription: '',
		historicalFigure: 'throwaway-rudder.gif',
		historicalDescription: 'The rudder is a directional control surface along with the rudder-like elevator. It is usually attached to the fin  which allows the pilot to control yaw about the vertical axis, i.e. change the horizontal direction in which the nose is pointing.'
