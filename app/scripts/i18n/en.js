		historicalDescription: 'Kutta was born in Pitschen, Upper Silesia (today Byczyna, Poland). In 1901, he co-developed the Runge-Kutta method, used to solve ordinary differential equations numerically. He is also remembered for the Zhukovsky-Kutta aerofoil, the Kutta-Zhukovsky theorem and the Kutta condition in aerodynamics.'
